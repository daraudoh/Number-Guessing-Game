# Number-Guessing-Game

Created a number guessing game that:
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Asks the player for their guess.
- Displays whether the guess is higher or lower than the number.
- Uses a while loop until they get the correct answer.
- Ends the loop when the player guesses the right number.
